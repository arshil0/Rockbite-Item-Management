In order to run the program, build and run the Main.java file in the "src" folder

I made the program using Intellij, but it should work with other programs

in order to get the list of commands, type "help".

I wouldv'e loved to also have a save system, but unfortunately ran out of time :D

hopefully the program has no bugs
